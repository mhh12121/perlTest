# Simple calculator

## Description
This is a demo written in Perl. It provides simple calculation.
Its general framework is generated by Mojolious...I just changed some codes inside.
And it can be used from both front-end and CLI.
Though there're load of bugs...but this is just for getting familiar with Perl;

## Env
- Perl 5.22
- Ubuntu
- Mojolious 8.10

## Usage

1. ```git clone https://github.com/mhh12121/perlTest.git```
2. ``` make install ```
3. Front-end: ``` morbo /script/hello_world ``` then you can access it through localhost:3000 
4. under ```/script``` run ```perl commandCal.pl [op] [num1] [num2]``` 
op is the operator, num1 is left side number and num2 is the other number

## Todo
Add Regular Expression Calculation;
Support BigNum;
Floating Factorial(Gamma);
